# Games-Portal
This website was created as a project for final submission for a subject called Seminar-II, during IV semester of my Computer Engineering.
Below are the screenshots of the website.

The website is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL database.

The idea behind making Games Portal was to provide people a platform to host and play Indie Games, share feedback and improve their Games Development Skills.
